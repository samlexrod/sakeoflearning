# Research & Project Ideas

- Which professional path (education, experience, education/experience, overlapping education/experience) leads to the most success?
- Build a recommender systems for movies.
- Predict box office success.

# Data Analysis Process

Focus: Data-Driven Quesitons <- Best place to start the process

- **Collecting Data** from various sources
  - Have a data driven question to guide you.
  - Know the types of questions and problems solvable with machine learning.
  - Collect as much data as you possibly can, focusing on samples.
  - We need to pay special care on this step, so we can collect enough data to provide effectiveness.
- **Wrangling Data** to make it more reliable
- **Exploring Data** using statistics and visualizations
- **Transforming Data** to prepare it for modeling
- **Modeling Data** using the right machine learning algorithms
  - Know how unsupervised and supervised learning are different.
- **Evaluating** the results of the data models

*This a field of unquence imagination and curiosity.*

# Types of Machine Learning
1. Unsupervised learning 
- Extracts patterns
2. Supervised learning 
- Tries to fit rules and equations
3. Reinforcement learning

# Dimensionality Reduction
- This is the process of trimming your dataset into a more consice and essensial input for the data model.
- It falls in the unsupervised learning realm because you don't instruct the computer wich features you want it to create.
