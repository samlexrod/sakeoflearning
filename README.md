## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning and to share my knowledge with the community. I will be sharing tutorials, code snippets, and best practices that I have learned over the years. I will be using Python as the primary programming language and Jupyter Notebooks as the primary tool for documentation.

It is mainly foucused in the following areas:
- Data Engineering
    - Data Ingestion
    - Data Processing
    - Data Storage
    - Data Analysis
- Classical Machine Learning
    - Supervised Learning
    - Unsupervised Learning
