    "# FastAPI Real-Time API with WebSockets\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **real-time API** using FastAPI and **WebSockets**. By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand the basics of WebSockets and how they differ from HTTP.\n",
    "2. Set up a FastAPI app with WebSocket support.\n",
    "3. Create a WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication.\n",
    "4. Handle WebSocket connections and disconnections gracefully.\n",

    "## 1. Understanding WebSockets\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are WebSockets?\n",
    "WebSockets provide a **full-duplex communication channel** over a single, long-lived connection between a client and a server. Unlike HTTP, which follows a request-response model, WebSockets allow **real-time, bidirectional communication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of WebSockets:\n",
    "- **Persistent Connection**: The connection remains open until explicitly closed by either the client or the server.\n",
    "- **Low Latency**: Messages are sent and received instantly, making WebSockets ideal for real-time applications.\n",
    "- **Bidirectional Communication**: Both the client and server can send messages at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases for WebSockets:\n",
    "    - Chat applications\n",
    "    - Live notifications\n",
    "    - Real-time dashboards\n",
    "    - Multiplayer online games"

    "## 2. Connect to the FastAPI Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you're using the correct kernel (`fastapi-env`) that has all the required dependencies installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions to Connect to the Kernel:\n",
    "1. **Check Available Kernels**:\n",
    "   - Click on the kernel name in the top-right corner of the notebook (e.g., `Python 3`).\n",
    "   - Select **`Python (FastAPI)`** from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Missing Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Open the notebook **fastapi-quickstart.ipynb** and follow the environment/kernel installation steps.\n",
    "   - Restart the Jupyter kernel and select the `SilverAIWolf (FastAPI)` kernel."

    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate with Front-End Frameworks**:\n",
    "   - Build a front-end interface using frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular to interact with the WebSocket API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scale the Application**:\n",
    "   - Use tools like Redis or Kafka to handle high volumes of messages and scale the chat application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Authentication**:\n",
    "   - Implement user authentication to secure the WebSocket connection and personalize chat messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explore Advanced Features**:\n",
    "   - Add features like typing indicators, message history, and file sharing to enhance the chat application.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Move to Production**:\n",
    "   - Deploy the FastAPI app using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Learn More**:\n",
    "   - Explore advanced WebSocket integration techniques in the next notebook: **`fastapi-websockets-integration.ipynb`**."
